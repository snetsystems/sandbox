# ------------ Pipeline Settings --------------
#
# The ID of the pipeline.
#
# pipeline.id: main


# Set the number of workers that will, in parallel, execute the filters+outputs
# stage of the pipeline.
#
# This defaults to the number of the host's CPU cores.
# pipeline.workers: 16
#
# How many events to retrieve from inputs before sending to filters+workers
#
# pipeline.batch.size: 125
#
# How long to wait in milliseconds while polling for the next event
# before dispatching an undersized batch to filters+outputs
#
# pipeline.batch.delay: 50
#
# Force Logstash to exit during shutdown even if there are still inflight
# events in memory. By default, logstash will refuse to quit until all
# received events have been pushed to the outputs.
#
# WARNING: Enabling this can lead to data loss during shutdown
#
# pipeline.unsafe_shutdown: false
#
# Set the pipeline event ordering. Options are "auto" (the default), "true" or "false".
# "auto" automatically enables ordering if the 'pipeline.workers' setting
# is also set to '1', and disables otherwise.
# "true" enforces ordering on the pipeline and prevent logstash from starting
# if there are multiple workers.
# "false" disables any extra processing necessary for preserving ordering.
#
# pipeline.ordered: auto
